# ReadyKit Edge

Air-gapped visual inspection for equipment kits, with physical actuation.

A camera watches an equipment kit. A vision-language model running locally on a
Qualcomm Hexagon NPU decides whether the kit is complete and serviceable. That
decision drives a fail-secure latch on an Arduino UNO Q. Nothing leaves the
device — no cloud, no network call, no remote fallback.

Built for **Qualcomm Snapdragon® X Elite** (inference) + **Arduino® UNO™ Q**
(actuation).

## The one rule

> **Absence of evidence is not evidence of compliance.**

A Verdict is one of three values, not two:

| Verdict | Meaning | Latch |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | Every critical item positively found above the confidence floor | **Released** for the manifest's hold |
| `FAIL` | A positive finding that the kit is non-compliant | Engaged |
| `INDETERMINATE` | Compliance could not be established — occluded, low confidence, unparseable, or the model simply didn't say | Engaged |

`PASS` is never the fallthrough branch. An empty reply, a crashed engine, a
dropped serial link, and a fogged lens all land on `INDETERMINATE`, and
`INDETERMINATE` never opens anything.

This matters because the obvious implementation gets it backwards. Matching
`"missing" in reply or "no" in reply` against free model text means
`"I cannot determine, the tray is occluded"` contains neither token and is read
as a pass — releasing the latch on a kit nobody has actually seen. Meanwhile
`"No items are missing"` contains both and is read as a failure. See
[`tests/test_verdict.py`](tests/test_verdict.py), which pins both cases.

## Run the original design beside it

That claim is checkable rather than rhetorical. [`src/readykit/naive.py`](src/readykit/naive.py)
is the original substring matcher, preserved and executable, and every
inspection replays it against the **same verbatim model reply** before
recording what it would have done:

```bash
.venv/bin/readykit compare --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json
```

```
scene                   blueprint           readykit        divergence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
complete                PASS_KIT            pass            agreed
complete-negated        ERR_MISSING_TOOL    pass            rejects a good kit
empty                   ERR_MISSING_TOOL    fail            agreed
expired                 PASS_KIT            fail            UNLOCKS A BAD KIT
short                   PASS_KIT            fail            UNLOCKS A BAD KIT
occluded                PASS_KIT            indeterminate   UNLOCKS A BAD KIT
missing-shears          PASS_KIT            fail            UNLOCKS A BAD KIT
...

11 of 19 scenes would have released the latch under the original design.
```

The sharpest one is `missing-shears`. The model correctly reports the shears
are gone — it just phrases it as *"Absent from the tray"*. No `"missing"`, no
`"no"`, so the original design writes `PASS_KIT` and opens a trauma kit with no
trauma shears in it.

Two things keep this honest rather than a strawman:

- **The blueprint gets some right.** It handles `complete` and `empty`
  correctly, and it rejects *"Sorry, I could not process that image"* — because
  `"could not"` happens to contain `"no"`. Correct, and entirely by accident.
  [`tests/test_naive.py`](tests/test_naive.py) pins that case deliberately.
- **Both parsers read the same string.** The simulator emits realistic model
  output — prose narration plus a JSON block, which is what instruction-tuned
  VLMs actually produce — and that text goes through the production parser.
  The console shows the verbatim line the substring match ran against.

The replay is recorded and displayed, never enacted. `naive.py` cannot reach
the Host Link, and a test asserts the latch stays engaged on an `unsafe`
divergence.

## First, on unfamiliar hardware

```bash
readykit doctor
```

Reports whether GenieX is installed, **which serial port the UNO Q is on**,
whether the camera opens, whether the manifests parse, and whether the audit
log is writable — each with the exact command that fixes it. Run it before you
need any of those to work.

> **Setting up a Snapdragon X Elite laptop from scratch?**
> [`docs/windows-setup.md`](docs/windows-setup.md) is the ordered sequence,
> including the one dependency that has no Windows ARM64 wheel.
>
> **On a Snapdragon X Elite AI PC** the host is Windows ARM64, so the commands
> below are written `.venv/bin/readykit` but you type `.venv\Scripts\readykit`.
> `readykit doctor` prints the form that works on the machine it is running on.

## Running it without the hardware

The full pipeline runs on any machine. Capture, inference, and the host link
each sit behind an interface with both a real and a simulated implementation,
so you can drive the whole system — including latch state and the audit trail —
before the boards arrive.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"

# One inspection against a scripted scene
.venv/bin/readykit inspect --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json --scene complete

# The same kit with the shears removed
.venv/bin/readykit inspect --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json --scene missing-shears

# A fogged lens — the case that must NOT unlock
.venv/bin/readykit inspect --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json --scene occluded
```

## Presence is not serviceability

A kit can be complete, undamaged, every tick green — and still fail:

```bash
.venv/bin/readykit inspect --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json --scene expired
```

```
  FAIL  latch engaged
  Kit non-compliant: expired Vented Chest Seal
    + Windlass Tourniquet    found      0.97
    x Vented Chest Seal      found      0.96  EXPIRED 2026-07-30
    + Trauma Shears          found      0.94
    ...
```

A sealed, undamaged, correctly-placed packet of expired haemostatic gauze
satisfies every visual check and is still not something to hand a medic.
Reading a printed date off crumpled foil and reasoning about it is work object
detection cannot do — it is why this is a vision-language model.

Expiry obeys the same rule as everything else rather than getting a special
case. A date that could not be read is **unresolved**, not assumed fine, so a
smudged use-by fails closed exactly like an occluded item. The prompt tells the
model to omit the field rather than guess, because an invented expiry is the
one hallucination that would manufacture a pass.

## Two is not one

A manifest can require more than one of something, and one of a required pair
is a kit that runs out halfway through:

```bash
.venv/bin/readykit inspect --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json --scene short
```

```
  FAIL  latch engaged
  Kit non-compliant: short on Windlass Tourniquet
    < Windlass Tourniquet    found      0.97  1/2
    + Vented Chest Seal      found      0.96  2/2  exp 2027-10-20
    + Trauma Shears          found      0.94
```

Counting obeys the same rule as everything else. A count that was never taken
is **unresolved**, not assumed sufficient — `--scene count-unreadable` shows
`?/2` and resolves to INDETERMINATE, because "I can see tourniquets" does not
establish that there are two of them. The parser refuses to coerce a bad count
to the required number, which is the one place it could manufacture a pass, and
frames that disagree on a count establish no count rather than taking the
minimum or the maximum.

## The audit trail

Every record is hash-chained to the one before it:

```bash
.venv/bin/readykit audit
```

```
  chain intact over 4 records
  head 968db8eeaeddd07590cdf13c73c98912
```

Edit a recorded `FAIL` into a `PASS` and it names the record you touched:

```
  CHAIN BROKEN
  record 1 (9b71768bdd1e) does not match its own hash - its contents were
  edited after it was written
```

Losing power mid-write is reported as `TRUNCATED`, not as tampering, and
appending afterwards continues the chain from the last complete record. An
air-gapped field device will lose power eventually, and crying wolf about it
would train operators to ignore the alarm.

This is tamper-**evident**, not tamper-proof — it does not stop someone with
write access who rebuilds every subsequent hash. The CLI says so every time it
runs.

## Running it on the hardware

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[host]"
.venv/bin/readykit inspect \
  --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json \
  --engine geniex --model qualcomm/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct \
  --camera 0 \
  --link serial --port /dev/ttyACM0
```

See [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for model export, firmware
flashing, and wiring.

## The operator console

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[console]"
.venv/bin/readykit console --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json
# http://127.0.0.1:8420
```

Live verdict, per-item checklist, actuator telemetry (latch, indicator,
buzzer, link freshness, last acknowledged sequence), and the audit trail.

That command serves scripted scenes. Point it at a real camera and a real
model and it inspects what the camera sees:

```bash
.venv/bin/readykit console --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json \
  --camera 0 --engine geniex --model qualcomm/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct
```

```bash
# any machine, when GenieX will not install
.venv/bin/readykit console --manifest manifests/desk-rehearsal.json \
  --camera 0 --engine ollama --model qwen2.5vl
```

A live console **drops the scene picker** and names its input instead. An
operator reading a dropdown of scene names believes the input is scripted, so
showing one in front of a live camera would report a verdict about their
actual kit under the name of a rehearsal — the same lie as a simulated latch
beside a real one. For the same reason `--camera` without a real model is
refused up front rather than one button press later: the simulated engine
answers from a scene name and never looks at the frame.

It binds to loopback deliberately: this device releases a physical latch on
command, and binding it to a routable interface would turn a local view into a
remote actuator.

The latch pill in the banner always shows the latch **now**, never the latch at
the moment of the verdict — a hold expires while the banner is still on screen,
and nobody should read "released" over telemetry saying "engaged" before
reaching into an enclosure.

## Layout

```
src/readykit/
  domain.py        Manifest, Sighting, Verdict, resolve_verdict — pure, no I/O
  protocol.py      Host Link framing: commands, checksums, acknowledgement
  capture.py       Frame sources — camera and scripted
  inference/       Engines — GenieX on Hexagon NPU, and a simulator
  bridge/          Host Link transports — pyserial and loopback
  engine.py        The inspection loop
  recorder.py      Append-only Inspection Records
  console/         Operator console — FastAPI + static page
  cli.py

```

Domain vocabulary is defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). The terms there are
load-bearing; each lists what it must not be confused with.

Visual language for the operator console is [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## Other commands

```bash
readykit demo     --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json   # scripted five-beat sequence
readykit compare  --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json   # every scene vs the original design
readykit bench    --manifest manifests/trauma-kit-a.json   # measured inference latency
readykit audit                                             # verify the record chain
readykit scenes                                            # list simulator scenes
```

`--frames N` aggregates several looks per inspection. Frames that disagree
produce doubt rather than an average: two frames saying found and two saying
absent is not "probably fine", it is a kit nobody has established anything
about.

New to the project, or explaining it to someone who is?
[`docs/what-we-are-building.md`](docs/what-we-are-building.md) is the whole
thing in plain English, no jargon.

For the pitch, [`docs/demo.md`](docs/demo.md) is a timed run-of-show with the
questions judges actually ask, and [`docs/one-pager.md`](docs/one-pager.md) is
the handout.

## Development

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/mypy
```

## Status

Runs end to end in simulation; every fail-closed path is covered by tests.

**Not yet run on the hardware.** The GenieX and pyserial backends are written
against their documented interfaces, and the C firmware parser is cross-checked
against the Python encoder by a test that compiles it — but nothing here has
been flashed. The sketch is compiled on every CI run under five different pin
configurations, and the indicator logic is asserted rather than eyeballed, so
what remains unproven is the STM32U585 toolchain and the board's own macros,
not the code. Treat the on-device behaviour as unproven until the
[bring-up checklist](docs/deployment.md#bring-up-checklist) has been worked
through.

That checklist is the point of building the simulator first. Every item on it
is a behaviour already pinned by a test, so bench time goes on confirming the
hardware agrees rather than discovering what the hardware does. The item that
matters most is the cloth-over-the-tray one: if a covered kit ever passes, stop
and raise the confidence floor.

Known gaps are listed at the end of that document.
